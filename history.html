					<h1>A brief history...</h1>
					<p>The Maserati story begins with railroad worker Rodolfo Maserati, his wife Carolina Losi and seven Maserati children who all inherit their father's passion for speed 	and precision engineering.
						1914, December 1st: Alfieri, Ettore and Ernesto Maserati open the “Società Anonima Officine Alfieri Maserati”, a car workshop at 1, via de'Pepoli in Bologna. Five months later Italy is at war and the brothers technical ingenuity is put to the test.
						1926: during the winter months, Alfieri, Ernesto and Ettore work tirelessly on their first original creation: the Tipo 26. It's the first car named Maserati and it's 	proudly displaying the soon-to-be-famous Trident logo.
						1929, September 28: in Cremona, Italy, Borzacchini sets the new Class C world record at the wheel of the 16-cylinder V4, flying 10 kilometers at a speed of 246.069 km/h. This record stands until 1937.
						1937, May 1: Adolfo Orsi, an entrepreneur from Modena, purchases Maserati from the Maserati brothers.
						1939, May 30: Wilbur Shaw, at the wheel of the “Boyle Special” 8 CTF, wins the Indianapolis 500 at an average speed of 185.131 km/h (115.035 mph).
						1939, September 1: Maserati officially moves from Bologna to Modena, to the factory at 322 viale Ciro Menotti.
						1940, May 30: at the wheel of the same car, Wilbur Shaw wins the Indianapolis 500 for the second consecutive time, at an average speed of 183.911 km/h (114.227 mph).
						1947: the A6 1500 is presented at the Geneva Motor Show. Designed by Pininfarina, the car is named after Alfieri and the number of cylinders. It's the first Maserati 	destined for daily use rather than racing, and is a huge success.
						1957: the 3500 GT is presented at the Geneva Motor Show and production levels scale up to meet an increasing demand for grand tourers.
						1957, August 4: on the famous Nürburgring, Juan Manuel Fangio wins the German GP at the wheel of the 250 F. With this win, Fangio wins the Formula One world championship 	title - his fifth, Maserati's second.
						1963: the first Quattroporte is presented at the Turin Motor Show, introducing a whole new category to the marketplace: the luxury sports sedan.
						1966: the first Ghibli, designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, is presented at the Turin Motor Show.
						1971: the Maserati Bora, another of Giugiaro's masterpieces, is presented at the Geneva Motor Show. Adolfo Maserati and his son Omar feel they are out of place in the 	new Maserati, and they step down.
						A new car is introduced in the 1980s: the Maserati Biturbo. Beautiful and extremely powerful, the 6-cylinder 1,996 cc with two compressors can reach speeds of 215 km/h.
						The President of the Republic of Italy, Sandro Pertini, selects the Quattroporte III as his Presidential limousine.
						2013: the Detroit Motor Show is the setting for the worldwide introduction of the 6th generation Quattroporte, while the Ghibli, a re-envisioned and wildly successful 	mid-sized sedan, is presented at the Shanghai Motor Show.
						2014: Maserati presents its concept car Alfieri at the Geneva Motor Show and celebrates its Centennial Anniversary.
						2016 and 2017: the brand continues to innovate thanks to the launch of Levante, the Maserati of SUVs, at the Geneva Motor Show and the presentation of the rest
